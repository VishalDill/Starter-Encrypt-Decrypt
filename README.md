# Starter-Encrypt-Decrypt
This is the repository for the Encrypt Decrypt program created by Vishal Dillibabu, Shyan Vilvarajah, Rabten Tsering. This program uses a non standard encrytpion algorithim created by us that encrypts and decrypts any type of file.

Intro: 
Hello Deer hack Judges, we are Agency Enterprises and we are a group of 3 first year CS Students, Shyan, Vishal and Rabten. 

Overall: 
We have created an encryption / decryption application with our own custom algorithm. You can select any type of file, and our application will encrypt the data of said file and return to you the password to decrypt the file. 

GUI:
We have created an GUI that will allow you to search through your File Explorer and after it is selected you are presented with the option to encrypt or decrypt.

Decrypt:
For the Decryption process, the application itself has a encrypted master list of passwords for all files the user has encrypted before. The user DOES NOT have access to this master list. 
If the user wishes to access/ decrypt one of their files, they must enter the password associated with that file. Furthermore, the file they’re trying to decrypt MUST be a file that has already been encrypted.
If any of the clauses are not met, the application will inform the user of the clause not met and prompt them to try again.
